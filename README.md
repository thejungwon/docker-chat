# Radix Simple Chat

Divide the socket.io sample app into react.js and node.js.

## Getting Started

App with multiple containers. Reverse proxy.
![Screen Shopt](images/reverse-proxy.png?raw=true "Screen Shot")

Two containers.
  * front-end(nginx+react.js)
  * back-end(node.js)

To use the internal DNS between two containers, Nginx works as a reverse proxy.



### Prerequisites

Make sure you have already installed both Docker Engine and Docker Compose.
You donâ€™t need to install node.js or react.js, as both are provided by Docker images.


```
$ docker -v
Docker version 18.03.1-ce, build 9ee9f40
$ docker-compose -v
docker-compose version 1.21.1, build 5a3f1a3
```

### Installing

```
git clone https://github.com/thejungwon/docker-chat.git
cd docker-chat
docker-compose up
```
